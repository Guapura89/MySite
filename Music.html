            <h1>Hip hop</h1>
            <img src="img/hiphop.jpg" />
            <p>hip-hop is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans, Latino Americans and
                Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City. The origin of the name is often disputed. It is also
                argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. hip hop is characterized by four key
                elements: "rapping" (also called MCing or emceeing).</p>

            <h1>Classic music</h1>
            <img src="img/classic.jpg" />
            <p>It is a musical genre based on the liturgical and secular musical traditions of the West, especially in
                Europe. And the most relevant interpreters or authors were: Wagner, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin.
                The trajectory began in the 11th century and continues until now, but its most relevant period spans 400
                years from the mid-16th century to the early 20th century.

            <h1>Jazz</h1>
            <img src="img/jazz.jpg" />
            <p>We can say that jazz is characterized mainly by: improvisation, the treatment of rhythm, the use of
                offbeat notes and syncopations. One of the greatest jazz musicians was the trumpeter Louis Armstrong,
                but artists such as Les Paul, Ray Charles or Tito Puente are also known throughout the world, as well as
                the well-known Frank Sinatra.</p>

            <h1>Country</h1>
            <img src="img/country.jpg" />
            <p>Traditional country is characterized by the use of certain string instruments such as the guitar, the
                banjo, the simple violin and the double bass. The accordion and harmonica also frequently intervened.
                Some of its best known representatives are: Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline or Garth Brooks.</p>

            <h1>Funk</h1>
            <img src="img/funk.jpg" />
            <p>It was born thanks to some soul artists such as James Brown who during the 60s developed a more rhythmic
                and energetic style with very powerful bass lines. This genre was the starting point for many new styles
                of dance music such as disco. George Clinton, Jamiroquai, Prince and Maceo Parker represent this musical
                style very well.

            <h1>Reggae</h1>
            <img src="img/jazz.jpg" />
            <p>It originated in Jamaica thanks to the influence of ska and rocksteady, but also by other styles such as
                blues or jazz. However, in this case the song lyrics are linked to social criticism and address all
                kinds of topics.
                Bob Marley was the one who popularized this genre and the highest representative of it. But we can't
                stop citing others like: Los Cafres, Lee Perry, Jimmy Cliff and Gregory Isaacs.</p>

                United States, whose origins come from blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock. It is one of the most
                controversial types of music as many distinguish Traditional Heavy Metal from a more general Heavy
                Metal. </p>

                in the early 80s and is one of the types of electronic music that has evolved the most and has given
                more subgenres since its birth.</p>
